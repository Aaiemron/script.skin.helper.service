### Tools and actions provided by the script
The script provides several tools and actions which you can use in your skin.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Music library search
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=musicsearch)
```
This command will open the default search window for the music library. Might come in handy if you want to create a shortcut to music search from outside the music library window.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________



#### Video library search (extended)
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=videosearch)
```
This command will open the special search window in the script. It has a onscreen keyboard to quickly search for movies, tvshows and episodes. You can customize the look and feel of this search dialog. To do that include the files script-skin_helper_service-CustomSearch.xml and script-skin_helper_service-CustomInfo.xml in your skin and skin it to your needs.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________



#### Color Picker
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=colorpicker,skinstring=XXX)
```
This command will open the color picker of the script. After the user selected a color, the color will be stored in the skin string. Required parameters:
- skinstring: Skin String inwhich the value of the color (ARGB) will be stored.

In your skin you can just use the skin string to color a control, example: <textcolor>$INFO[Skin.String(defaultLabelColor)]</textcolor>

Note: If you want to display the name of the selected color, add a prefix .name to your skin string.
For example: <label>Default color for labels: $INFO[Skin.String(defaultLabelColor.name)]</label>

If you want to customize the look and feel of the color picker window, make sure to include script-skin_helper_service-ColorPicker.xml in your skin and skin in to your needs.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________




#### Youtube trailer search
Shows a dialog with all trailers found by the Youtube plugin, replace [MOVIETITLE] with the movie title (or info label in the skin). To be used for example in DialogVideoInfo.xml to let the user select a trailer instead of playing the default one.
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=searchtrailer,title=[MOVIETITLE])             
```



#### Busy spinner selector
Allows the user to select a busy spinner from some predefined ones in your skin. It supports both multiimage (folder with images) and single image (.gif) spinners. The user can provide his own texture(s) or select from predefined spinners in the skin.

```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=busytexture)             
```
The script fills this Skin Strings after selection: 
SpinnerTexture --> the name of the selected busy texture
SpinnerTexturePath --> The full path of the selected busy texture

#####To provide busy spinners with your skin:
- Make sure to create a directory "busy_spinners" in your skin's extras folder.
- Inside that directory you can put subdirectories for multimage spinners or just gif files in the root.

#####To use the busy texture
Make sure that you use a multiimage control in DialogBusy.xml. Example code:
```xml
<control type="multiimage">
	<width>150</width>
	<height>150</height>
	<aspectratio>keep</aspectratio>
	<imagepath>$INFO[Skin.String(SpinnerTexturePath)]</imagepath>
	<timeperimage>100</timeperimage>
	<colordiffuse>$INFO[Skin.String(SpinnerTextureColor)]</colordiffuse>
	<fadetime>0</fadetime>
	<visible>!Skin.String(SpinnerTexturePath,None)</visible>
</control>
```




________________________________________________________________________________________________________



#### Views selector
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setview)               
```
This feature shows the user a select dialog with all the views that are available. This replaces the default "toggle" button in the MyXXNav.xml windows. Note that you must create a views.xml file in your skin's extras folder. The selection dialog is built from that views.xml file and auto checks the visibility conditions so a view will only be shown if it's suitable for the current media content.

*example content of the views.xml file (to be placed in extras folder of your skin):*
```xml
<views>
    <view id="List" value="50" languageid="31443" type="all"/>
	  <view id="Thumbs details" value="512" languageid="31439" type="movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets,episodes,artists,albums,songs,tvchannels,tvrecordings,programs,pictures" />
	  <view id="Poster Shift" value="514" languageid="31441" type="movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets" />
</views>
```
id = the unlocalized version of the views name.
value = the skin view ID.
languageid = localized label ID.
type = the type of content the view is suitable for, use "all" to support all types. 

Supported types are currently: movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets,episodes,artists,albums,songs,tvchannels,tvrecordings,programs,pictures

Note: If you want a thumbnail of the view displayed in the select dialog, you need to create some small screenshots of your views and place them in your skin's extras folder:
- in your skin\extras folder, create a subfolder "viewthumbs"
- inside that viewthumbs folder save a .JPG file (screenshot) for all your views. Save them as [VIEWID].jpg where [VIEWID] is the numeric ID of the view.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________



#### Enable views
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=enableviews)             
```
This will present a selection dialog to the user to enable (or disable) views. It uses the views.xml file to display the available views (see above). When a view is disabled it will be hidden from the view selection dialog. Also, a Skin String will be set so you can check in your skin if the view has been diable (and not include it or set a visiblity condition).
The name of the Skin String that will be set by the script is: View.Disabled.[VIEWID] where [VIEWID] is the numerical ID of the view.

Example: <include condition="!Skin.HasSetting(View.Disabled.55)">View_55_BannerList</include>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________



#### Set Forced views
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setforcedview,contenttype=[TYPE])             
```
The script can help you to set a forced view for a specific contenttype in your skin. For example if the user wants to set the list view for all tvshow content etc. For [TYPE] you must fill in one of the content types, see above at "Views selector". When a button is pressed with the above command, a select dialog appears and the user can choose on of the available views. Disabled views and views that aren't suitable for the specified type are hidden from the list.
When the user made a choice from the list a Skin String will be filled by the script: ForcedViews.[TYPE]
The value of that skin string is the numeric ID of the selected view.

Note: It is recommended that you create a Skin toggle to enable/disable the forced views feature.

Note 2: When the user select another view in the normal viewselector, the forcedview setting will also be set to the newly chosen view.



##### How to use the forced views feature in your skin?

Example code to use in your skin settings:

```xml
<control type="radiobutton" id="6009">
	<label>Enable forced views</label>
	<onclick>Skin.ToggleSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</onclick>
	<selected>Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</selected>
</control>
<control type="button" id="6010">
	<onclick>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setforcedview,contenttype=movies)</onclick>
	<visible>Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</visible>
	<label>Forced view for movies: $INFO[Skin.String(ForcedViews.movies)]</label>
</control>
<control type="button" id="6011">
	<onclick>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setforcedview,contenttype=tvshows)</onclick>
	<visible>Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</visible>
	<label>Forced view for tv shows:  $INFO[Skin.String(ForcedViews.tvshows)]</label>
</control>
<control type="button" id="6012">
	<onclick>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setforcedview,contenttype=seasons)</onclick>
	<visible>Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</visible>
	<label>Forced view for seasons:  $INFO[Skin.String(ForcedViews.seasons)]</label>
</control>
<control type="button" id="6013">
	<onclick>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setforcedview,contenttype=episodes)</onclick>
	<visible>Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</visible>
	<label>Forced view for episodes: $INFO[Skin.String(ForcedViews.episodes)]</label>
	<font>Reg28</font>
</control>
<control type="button" id="6014">
	<onclick>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setforcedview,contenttype=sets)</onclick>
	<visible>Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</visible>
	<label>Forced view for movie sets: $INFO[Skin.String(ForcedViews.sets)]</label>
</control>
<control type="button" id="6015">
	<onclick>RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setforcedview,contenttype=setmovies)</onclick>
	<visible>Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled)</visible>
	<label>Forced view for movies inside set: $INFO[Skin.String(ForcedViews.setmovies)]</label>
</control>
```

Example code to use for your views visibility conditions:
```xml
<control type="panel" id="51">
	<visible>!Skin.HasSetting(ForcedViews.Enabled) | 
	[Container.Content(movies) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.movies,None)] | 
	[Container.Content(tvshows) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.tvshows,None)] | 
	[Container.Content(seasons) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.seasons,None)] | 
	[Container.Content(episodes) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.episodes,None)] | 
	[Container.Content(movies) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.movies,None)] | 
	[Container.Content(tvshows) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.tvshows,None)] | 
	[Container.Content(seasons) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.seasons,None)] | 
	[Container.Content(episodes) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.episodes,None)] | 
	[[Container.Content(sets) | StringCompare(Container.Folderpath,videodb://movies/sets/)] + Skin.String(ForcedViews.sets,51)] | 
	[Container.Content(movies) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.movies,51) + !substring(Container.FolderPath,videodb://movies/sets/,left)] | 
	[Container.Content(movies) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.setmovies,51) + substring(Container.FolderPath,setid=)] | 
	[Container.Content(tvshows) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.tvshows,51)] | 
	[Container.Content(seasons) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.seasons,51)] | 
	[Container.Content(episodes) + Skin.String(ForcedViews.episodes,51)] | 
	[!Container.Content(movies) + !Container.Content(tvshows) + !Container.Content(seasons) + !Container.Content(episodes) + !Container.Content(sets)]
	</visible>
</control>
```
Note: The forced view code has to be added to all view controls in order to work properly.

### Color themes feature
The script comes with a color theme feature. Basically it's just a simplified version of the skin backup/restore feature but it only backs up the colorsettings. Color Themes has the following features:

- Present a list of skin provided color themes including screenshots.
- Let's the user save his custom settings to a color theme.
- Let's the user export his custom color theme to file.
- Let's the user import a custom color theme from file.

#####To present the dialog with all available color themes:
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=colorthemes)             
```


#####Save the user's current customizations to a custom colortheme:
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=createcolortheme)             
```

#####Import a custom colortheme from file:
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=restorecolortheme)             
```

#####Provide color themes with your skin
It is possible to deliver skin provided color themes. Those colorthemes are stored in the skin's extras\skinthemes folder.
If you want to create one or more skinprovided color themes (for example the defaults):
- Create a folder "skinthemes" in your skin's "extras" folder. 
- Make all color modifications in your skin to represent the colortheme
- Hit the button to save your colortheme (createcolortheme command)
- Name it and select the correct screenshot
- On the filesystem navigate to Kodi userdata\addon_data\[YOURSKIN]\themes
- Copy both the themename.theme and the themename.jpg file to your above created skinthemes directory
- Do this action for every theme you want to include in your skin.
- It is possible to change the description of the theme, just open the .themes file in a texteditor. You can change both the THEMENAME and the DESCRIPTION values to your needs.

#####What settings are stored in the theme file ?
All Skin Settings settings that contain one of these words: color, opacity, texture.
Also the skin's theme will be saved (if any). So, to make sure the skin themes feature works properly you must be sure that all of your color-settings contain the word color. If any more words should be supported, please ask.
