# script.skin.helper.service
a helper service for Kodi skins

### Settings for the script
The script does not have it's own settings dialog. The script is controlled by the skinner through skin settings to allow the skinner to fully integrate the settings of this script within the skin settings of the skin.

Important settings:

*setting name 		how to set 				description*
EnableExtraFanart	Skin.ToggleSetting(EnableExtraFanart)	enables the extrafanart background scanner

### Window Properties provided by the script
The script provides several window properties to provide additional info about your skin and media info.
The window properties can be called in your skin like this: $INFO[Window(Home).Property(propertyname)]

#### General window Properties
The window properties can be called in your skin like this: $INFO[Window(Home).Property(propertyname)]
```
Window(Home).Property(skinTitle)  --> your skin name including the version
Window(Home).Property(skinVersion) --> only the version of your skin
```

#### Extra fanart window property
This window property is only available when browsing the video library and when the following Skin Bool is true: EnableExtraFanart. 

The window properties can be called in your skin like this: $INFO[Window(Home).Property(propertyname)]
```
Window(Home).Property(ExtraFanArtPath)  --> will return the extrafanart path for the listitem, empty if none is found.
```

### Music library search
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=musicsearch)
```
This command will open the default search window for the music library. Might come in handy if you want to create a shortcut to music search from outside the music library window.

### Video library search (extended)
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=videosearch)
```
This command will open the special search window in the script. It has a onscreen keyboard to quickly search for movies, tvshows and episodes. You can customize the look and feel of this search dialog. To do that include the files script-skin_helper_service-CustomSearch.xml and script-skin_helper_service-CustomInfo.xml in your skin and skin it to your needs.

### Color Picker
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=colorpicker,skinstringName=XXX,skinstringValue=XXX)
```
This command will open the color picker of the script. After the user selected a color, the color will be stored in the skin string. Required parameters:
- skinstringName: Skin String in which the color name will be stored (like blue or magenta)
- skinstringValue: Skin String in which the value of the color (ARGB) will be stored.
In your skin you can just use the skin string to color a control, example: <textcolor>$INFO[Skin.String(defaultLabelColor)]</textcolor>

If you want to customize the look and feel of the color picker window, make sure to include script-skin_helper_service-ColorPicker.xml in your skin and skin in to your needs.


### Views selector
This feature shows the user a select dialog with all the views that are available. This replaces the default "toggle" button in the MyXXNav.xml windows. Note that you must create a views.xml file in your skin's extras folder. The selection dialog is built from that views.xml file and auto checks the visibility conditions so a view will only be shown if it's suitable for the current media content.

*action to call the dialog:*
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setview)               
```
*example content of the views.xml file (to be placed in extras folder of your skin):*
```
<views>
    <view id="List" value="50" languageid="31443" type="all"/>
	  <view id="Thumbs details" value="512" languageid="31439" type="movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets,episodes,artists,albums,songs,tvchannels,tvrecordings,programs,pictures" />
	  <view id="Poster Shift" value="514" languageid="31441" type="movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets" />
</views>
```
id = the unlocalized version of the views name.
value = the skin view ID.
languageid = localized label ID.
type = the type of content the view is suitable for, use "all" to support all types. 

Supported types are currently: movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets,episodes,artists,albums,songs,tvchannels,tvrecordings,programs,pictures

### Youtube trailer search
Shows a dialog with all trailers found by the Youtube plugin, replace [MOVIETITLE] with the movie title (or info label in the skin). To be used for example in DialogVideoInfo.xml to let the user select a trailer instead of playing the default one.
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=searchtrailer,title=[MOVIETITLE])             
```

### Enable views
This will present a selection dialog to the user to enable (or disable) views. It uses the views.xml file to display the available views (see above). When a view is disabled it will be hidden from the view selection dialog. Also, a Skin String will be set so you can check in your skin if the view has been diable (and not include it or set a visiblity condition).
The name of the Skin String that will be set by the script is: View.Disabled.[VIEWID] where viewId is the numerical ID of the view.
Example: <include condition="!Skin.HasSetting(View.Disabled.55)">View_55_BannerList</include>

*the command below can be launched from a button your skin settings window.
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=enableviews)             
```
