# script.skin.helper.service
a helper service for Kodi skins


### Available window Properties
The window properties can be called in your skin like this: $INFO[Window(Home).(Property(propertyname)]


### Music library search
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=musicsearch)
```
This command will open the default search window for the music library. Might come in handy if you want to create a shortcut to music search from outside the music library window.

### Video library search (extended)
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=videosearch)
```
This command will open the special search window in the script. It has a onscreen keyboard to quickly search for movies, tvshows and episodes. You can customize the look and feel of this search dialog. To do that include the files script-skin_helper_service-CustomSearch.xml and script-skin_helper_service-CustomInfo.xml in your skin and skin it to your needs.

### Color Picker
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=videosearch)
```

### Views selector
This feature shows the user a select dialog with all the views that are available. This replaces the default "toggle" button in the MyXXNav.xml windows. Note that you must create a views.xml file in your skin's extras folder. The selection dialog is built from that views.xml file and auto checks the visibility conditions so a view will only be shown if it's suitable for the current media content.

*action to call the dialog:*
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=setview)               
```
*example content of the views.xml file (to be placed in extras folder of your skin):*
```
<views>
    <view id="List" value="50" languageid="31443" type="all"/>
	  <view id="Thumbs details" value="512" languageid="31439" type="movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets,episodes,artists,albums,songs,tvchannels,tvrecordings,programs,pictures" />
	  <view id="Poster Shift" value="514" languageid="31441" type="movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets" />
</views>
```
id = the unlocalized version of the views name.
value = the skin view ID.
languageid = localized label ID.
type = the type of content the view is suitable for, use "all" to support all types. 

Supported types are currently: movies,setmovies,tvshows,musicvideos,seasons,sets,episodes,artists,albums,songs,tvchannels,tvrecordings,programs,pictures

### Youtube trailer search
Shows a dialog with all trailers found by the Youtube plugin, replace [MOVIETITLE] with the movie title (or info label in the skin). To be used for example in DialogVideoInfo.xml to let the user select a trailer instead of playing the default one.
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=searchtrailer,title=[MOVIETITLE])             
```

### Enable views
This will present a selection dialog to the user to enable (or disable) views. It uses the views.xml file to display the available views (see above). When a view is disabled it will be hidden from the view selection dialog. Also, a Skin String will be set so you can check in your skin if the view has been diable (and not include it or set a visiblity condition).
The name of the Skin String that will be set by the script is: View.Disabled.[VIEWID] where viewId is the numerical ID of the view.
Example: <include condition="!Skin.HasSetting(View.Disabled.55)">View_55_BannerList</include>

*the command below can be launched from a button your skin settings window.
```
RunScript(script.skin.helper.service,action=enableviews)             
```
